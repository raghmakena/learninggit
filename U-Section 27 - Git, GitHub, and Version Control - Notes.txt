git init
--This will create .git dir in the location from where the command is executed which is used to track, commit and version control the changes


Git flow will be like, 
1. Working directory - files created in working dir
2. Staging directory aka Staging area: the location where files/content will be placed from which git picks it up to perform operations like track, commit etc
3. Repository - files will be put into Repository after commit

The reason for having staging directory instead of directly putting the files to Repository is because we don't want to put everything in "local/working dir" into "repository"

###########
working dir --> staging dir --> local repository --> remote repository
###########

git status
--to know/list the tracked and untracked files of git

git add <filename> 
--to add/stage <filename> to staging area

git add .
--to add/stage everything in current dir to staging area

git restore --staged <filename>
--to remove/unstage files from staging area

git rm --cached <filename> 
--to remove/unstage files to staging area

git commit -m "<comment/message to be added describing what is changed>"
--this comment after flag "m" is very important as it describes the changes

git log
--to list details of commits like hash(which uniquely identifies the commit), who did it, at what time, and the commit message


git diff <filename>
--to track/identify the difference between local file and repository file

git checkout <filename>
--to restore the local file from an earlier version of the file stored in repository


…or create a new repository on the command line
############# git commands set up start
echo "# learninggit" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/raghmakena/learninggit.git
git push -u origin main
############# git commands set up end

…or push an existing repository from the command line
############# git remote repository commands set up start
git remote add origin https://github.com/raghmakena/learninggit.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
############# git remote repository commands set up end

git remote add <remote_name> <url>
--to add remote repository

--E.g.,
git remote add origin https://github.com/raghmakena/learninggit.git
--origin is the name to suggest the "remote" repository and we can use any word there instead of origin.
--but majority of the users use this as standard convention to mention remote repository

git push -u <remote_name> <branch_name>
git push -u origin main
--pushes the code in your local repository to remote repository using the "u" flag which links up remote and local repository
--main is the name of the branch which is the default branch

##### Below error will be returned if "git branch -M main" is not run before "git push"
$ git push -u origin main
error: src refspec main does not match any
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/raghmakena/learninggit.git'
